So you've all arrived here in[N]
my castle. Before I strike[AN]
you down, I shall tell you a[N]
story. After I exiled Kaga,[AN]
I rose up the ranks and became[N]
the director of Fire Emblem.[AN]
The series is printing money,[N]
as Kusakihara and I can prove.[AN]
Yes, you may detest Tharja and[N]
Peri, and you may be sickened[AN]
by Camilla's sheer fanservice.[N]
But the series would have died[AN]
otherwise! Do you really think[N]
that would be the right thing[AN]
to do? ...You'd rather Fire[N]
Emblem have died with "dignity"[AN]
instead of bringing in success?[N]
Very well. En garde![AN][X]

## MaedaDeath

Now look what you've done![N]
Now that I'm gone, Fire[AN]
Emblem will die with me...[N]
Damn you, Kaga! DAMN YOU!![AN][X]

Will anyone mourn me...?[A][X]

## TataraCombat
[ML][LoadTatara]

into my land. Decaying flesh,[AN]
to boot! I'm sick of dealing[N]
with you! Get outta here![AN]

I always told you I'd become a[N]
good unit, Evil Florina. Look[AN]
who's a powerful great knight,[N]
and then look at the weak shaman.[AN]
I was once weak and scorned. But[N]
now I am strong. You can become[AN]
strong too, if you follow me.[N]
It's a long road, but it's possible.[AN]
[Clear]
[MR][LoadFlorina]
You've well and truly lost it,[N]
haven't you? Completely lost it.[AN]

## Lyon2Combat
[OpenMidLeft][Load][0x4A]

have no honour. That's why[AN]
I wanted to conquer you, you[N]
Nintenlord-loving scum![AN][X]

## LyonVsVoid
[OpenMidLeft][Load][0x4A]
So you finally made it. Void,[N]
princess of a realm who's name[AN]
was stolen. Descended from your[N]
holy Babby, and wielder of the[AN]
Super Blitz. You've come here[N]
seeking revenge, to stop me[AN]
from reviving the Demon King[N]
Feditor, servant to our holy[AN]
Hextator. You are in my way,[N]
and the continent shall return[AN]
back to his control. By the[N]
power of Naglfar, farewell![AN]
[Clear]
[MR][LoadVoid]
You have killed my family.[N]
You have took over my country.[AN]
You've created so much misery.[N]

GWA...! WHY... WHY HAVE I...[N]
BEEN DEFEATED... SO EASILY...[AN]
IS THIS... THE POWER... OF[N]
THE BUILDFILE? BUT... HUMANS.[AN]
DON'T FORGET... AS LONG AS[N]
GREED LIVES ON IN YOUR HEARTS...[AN]
YOU WILL LOSE THE BUILDFILE AND[N]
I WILL RISE FROM THE EARTH ONCE[AN]
AGAIN... REMEMBER... THIS...[AN][X]
