The continent of Jugdral. It's a land[N]
with a long history, and most of it[AN]
a violent one. In the year 760, a[N]
great battle took place, known as the[AN]
Battle of Barhara. The forces of the[N]
duchies of Chalphy and Velthomer went[AN]
head to head, but eventually Lord Sigurd[N]
prevailed, and left the battle uncharred.[AN]
Soon after Sigurd and his wife, Deirdre,[N]
announced the birth of their daughter,[AN]
Julia, but not all was as it seemed.[N]
The truth was, she was actually the child[AN]
of Alvis, duke of Velthomer, who vanished[N]
after Barhara. She also had a twin brother...[AN]
Julius. Inheritor of the Dark Lord's[N]
power, and cast away from Grandbell.[AN]
Several years passed in peace, but[N]
Julius planned revenge in the shadows.[AN]
He met with the remmants of the Lopt[N]
Sect in Yied Shrine, and gathered some[AN]
soldiers known as the "Dark Warlords"[N]
from a conflict happening in Thracia.[AN]
The year is 777. The children of[N]
Sigurd's old army were at Barhara,[AN]
when suddenly, a new army took to the[N]
fold, lead by the forsaken prince, Julius.[AN][X]
