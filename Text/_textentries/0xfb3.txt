[ML][LoadWendy]
I always told you I'd become a[N]
good unit, Evil Florina. Look[AN]
who's a powerful great knight,[N]
and then look at the weak shaman.[AN]
I was once weak and scorned. But[N]
now I am strong. You can become[AN]
strong too, if you follow me.[N]
It's a long road, but it's possible.[AN]

[MR][LoadFlorina]
You've well and truly lost it,[N]
haven't you? Completely lost it.[AN]
I've paid some mercenaries well[N]
to finish this battle, so that[AN]
means your days are numbered. So[N]
long, Gwendolyn. It was fun.[AN][X]
