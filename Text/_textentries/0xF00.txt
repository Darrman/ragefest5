[MR][LoadVoid]
Barhara's throne at last. Finally,[N]
I've ousted those stupid Heims.[AN]
Nobody was even guarding the castle![N]
The king wasn't home, the queen[AN]
also wasn't home, and the prince[N]
is just messing around at Velthomer.[AN]
If I can snuff out Celice's life,[N]
then the world is mine. Brother...[AN]
You will regret being born! And[N]
as for your father... you should have[AN]
died twenty years ago. Dark Warlords![N]
I've this funny feeling that this[AN]
battle was meant to happen. And[N]
I shall prevail! The Scion of Light[AN]
shall meet his end, and the Dark Lord[N]
will rise again, and the Lopto Empire[AN]
shall return! That accursed Narga...[N]
...will bother me no more! Let's go![AN][X]
